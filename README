Obfuscator encodes arbitrary binary data into the case of words drawn
from a built-in word list.  The first four letters of each word are
used for encoding; remaining letters in each word, if any, are not
significant in the encoding.  Words in the word list which are shorter
than four letters may appear in the output, but are not used in the
encoding.  The total output is a whitespace-delimited, unpunctuated
list of words, or a word salad, within which the case of letters
varies without regard to grammatical standards or common usage norms.
