File Format Version 01.01: CRC in header

Version 01.01 of the obfuscation file format prepends sixteen (16)
bytes of metadata to the content data to form the bitstream which is
then ciphered via case-capable characters.  The bytes of this header
are as follows:

byte    use
0       the ASCII character L
1       the ASCII character N
2       the major version number of the encoding; set to one.
3       the minor version number of the encoding; set to one.  
4       reserved; set to zero
5       reserved; set to zero
6       reserved; set to zero
7       reserved; set to zero
8       LSB of length of content following header
9       next byte of length of content following header
10      next byte of length of content following header
11      MSB of length of content following header
12      LSB of crc of content following header
13      next byte of crc of content following header
14      next byte of crc of content following header
15      MSB of crc of content following header

Once ciphered, this header fills at least the first 160 characters
of text.
